# Dog_Match

## Description
This web app is used for matching people who have never owned a dog or maybe people who have only ever had a family dog with the perfect breed of dog for them.

The matching is a result of looking at the individuals lifestyle. These factors include what kind of housing you live in, how many ours per week do you work, if you live alone or with others, how active you are and many others.
